# Getting Started
I have not loaded any releases to github as of yet, so the editor must be built by src. I will be creating a **premake** build script shortly. Also, the code is not yet cross platform, so it will most likely only work on windows machines. Feel free to try to add your own implementation for Mac/linux.

Once the editor is open you can start working on your project. The first thing you are going to want to do is add the required tilesets for your project. You can do this by going to the tools menu and adding a tileset. See the <u>**[Adding Tilesets](./adding_tilesets.md)**</u> page for more information.
