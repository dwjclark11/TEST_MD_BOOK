# About 
JADE Tilemap Editor is a 2D Tilemap editor that allows you to easily create tilemaps for use with the **Pikuma Game Engine** and for the **JADE ENGINE** (Coming Soon!)
This tilemap editor was created as a final project for the course **"C++ Game Engine Programming"**. 
Check out that course here: <https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development>. The editor has been adapted to make 2D tilemaps for my new 2D SDL Game Engine I am currently creating. 

The Editor is created completely using SDL2, ImGui, C++, and Sol2 for loading ***.lua*** project files.

Some features are as follows:
- Add multiple tilesets
- Zoom in/out
- Undo/Redo
- Add box colliders
- Save to a *.map* or *.lua* file 
- Allows you to save your project to again later
